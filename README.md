  As someone who is into technology and machinery, reading Alan Turing's
“Computing Machinery and Intelligence” (1950) sparked an interest in me.
Turing's Imitation Game, now known as the Turing Test, challenged my 
understanding of what it means to be intelligent.He argues that a machine 
can be considered intelligent if it can answer questions and respond in a
way that seems human-like, even if it doesn't think exactly like a human.
Turing also addresses concerns about machine intelligence, such as the 
fact that machines can only do what they're programmed to do. He argues 
that this limitation doesn't necessarily mean that machines can't be 
intelligent. This made me think about the potential of machines to learn 
and adapt.

  What I found most impressive about Turing's paper is his vision for the 
future of machines. He wrote this paper over 70 years ago, when computers 
were still in their ealier years. Yet, he was already thinking about the 
possibilities of machines that could think and learn like humans.
This shows that Turing was way ahead of his time, and it makes me wonder 
what he would think of modern artificial intelligence, like Siri, Alexa, 
or ChatGPT.

  Turing's paper has made me think about the implications of machine 
intelligence on our society. If machines can be considered intelligent, 
what does this mean for our jobs, our relationships, and our way of life? 
These are questions that I don't have the answers to, but Turing's paper 
has made me realize the importance of considering them.
